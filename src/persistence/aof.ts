// AOF stands for Append Only File.
// It is a persistence mechanism used to log every write operation received by the server.
// The log is written in an append-only manner, ensuring that no data is lost and making it possible
// to rebuild the in-memory data store by replaying the logged operations.
// This approach provides durability and allows the server state to be reconstructed after a restart.
